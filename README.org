* Online Judge Problem Report

This repo currently contains my report on problems on [[http://poj.org/][POJ]], [[http://acm.zju.edu.cn/onlinejudge/][ZOJ]] and [[http://uva.onlinejudge.org/][UVa
Online Judge]].  I plan to finish as mush problems as I could.

For every problem I will write a short hint [[http://gongzhitaao.github.com/OJ-Report/]].

'+Besides the solutions, recently I plan to write a test data
generator based on my AC code+'.

Maybe we should not rely on data to discover the flaw of our logic. We
don't always have enough data to work on =).
